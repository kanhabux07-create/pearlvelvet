You noticed, took my arm, and stepped in closer. That was the first time I felt your warmth.",

    body: `
      If you are reading this, it means you've walked through all our little memories and unlocked the quietest corner of my heart.
      <br><br>
      I wanted to write this letter to tell you something simple, but something I don't say enough: <strong>thank you for existing</strong>. Thank you for walking into that bookstore, thank you for laughing at my dumb jokes, and thank you for trusting me with your heart.
      <br><br>
      Before I met you, life was a series of routines and grey days. With you, every Tuesday feels like an adventure, every quiet car ride feels like poetry, and even the rainiest days feel warm. You have taught me what patience looks like, what gentle kindness feels like, and what true love really means.
      <br><br>
      Whatever the future brings—whatever challenges, road trips, burnt dinners, or quiet Sunday mornings—I want you to know that I am right here by your side. I will celebrate your biggest wins, I will hold your hand through the hardest nights, and I will wake up every single morning choosing you all over again.
      <br><br>
      You are my today, my tomorrow, and my forever.
